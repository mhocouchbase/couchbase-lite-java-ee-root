== Test Databases

This directory contains copies of a test database encrypted using
the key "xyzzy".  The algorithm used is shown in the file suffix.

A simple test of SEE is to run the "build.sh" script in the parent
directory to build the various shell executables.  Then cd into this
directory and run the "test.sh" script to verify that there have been
no file format changes that prevent the databases from being understood.
