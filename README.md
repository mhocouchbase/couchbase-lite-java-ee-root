# Couchbase Lite 2.8

**Couchbase Lite** is an embedded lightweight, document-oriented (NoSQL), syncable database engine.

Couchbase Lite 2.0 has a completely new set of APIs. The implementation is on top of [Couchbase Lite Core](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-core), which is also a new cross-platform implementation of database CRUD and query features, as well as document versioning.

As with most CBL products, this one has Community and Enterprise editions.
This is the Enterprise edition.  The code is proprietary and not for publication
outside Couchbase.

There are several products that share code written in the Java language
(Android, Java-Appserver, and Java-Swing, among them.  Each has a CE and EE version).
The top level in this workspace contains:

legal: licenses for the Couchbase Lite products.
* core: Code for Couchbase Lite Core.

* common/common: code common to all products
